# OpenRW

OpenRW is an open source re-implementation of Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto III,
a classic 3D action game first published in 2001.

OpenRW requires a legitimate copy of the original PC game data in order to run.
Without this data it will not be possible to run openrw.

## Building

Dependencies:

* Bullet
* GLM (0.9.7+)
* SFML (2.0+)
* libmad
* Boost Test

Mac users should install Xcode and these packages from Homebrew:

brew install boost bullet glm mad sfml 

Global Options:

* BUILD_TESTS â€” Build the test suite
* BUILD_VIEWER - Build the Qt GUI for viewing data
* BUILD_SCRIPT_TOOL - Build the script dissassembler

### Recomended build

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

## Running

### rwgame

This is the game binary. Before running the game a config file is needed, by default
the game will look for ``~/.config/OpenRW/openrw.ini``, which should look like:

```
[game]
path=/opt/games/Grand Theft Auto 3/        ; Game data path

[input]
invert_y=0                                 ; Invert camera Y
```
Eventually the game will write this for you, but currently it must be done by
hand.

* Options:
    * -w **n**, -h **n** sets initial window size
    * --newgame starts a new game automatically
* Controls:
    * W/A/S/D: Move
    * Shift: Sprint
    * Space: Jump
    * F: Enter/Exit Vehicle
    * Mouse Wheel: Cycle weapons
    * Mouse 1: Fire Weapon

### rwviewer

This is a Qt tool for opening the game data. It currently supports  looking at
objects and their models, and a primitive world viewer. It needs more work to
be useful for looking inside archives and viewing textures.
